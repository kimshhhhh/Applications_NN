They hadn't been fed for many days it seems. However, with the help of Ruby, my own female cat at home, Amber has grown up to be a pretty girl. She has small eyes compared to her other siblings (that's where the Chinese nickname comes from). She's a special cat that has the flexibility to twist her body, and even likes to drink from her paw. Unfortunately, this smart and brilliant cat is afraid of heights. ^^ Below are pictures of Amber growing up :)",11,2

She absolutely loves to be petted but when your petting her she will make all sorts of funny and weird little chirping sounds. Also when petting her she will push her head into your side or into your lap rubbing and rubbing away as you pet her. It's just to cute. Also at feeding time it's pet me first then I'll eat my food. She is shy of new people and takes a while to warm up to strangers. Having said that once she knows you she will smoother you with cuteness. I know Callie is an older cat but just because she isn't under 6 months old doesn't mean anything. She is still as playful, loving and cute once you get to know her. If your interested in adopting Callie Call, SMS or Whatsapp either James (English only as I'm a Matsalleh) or Justin (English or BM) and we can arrange a meeting and see how it goes.",7,3
5904,Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,White,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Minor Injury,0,之前它常常跟随一位顾客来我们的咖啡店，它给我的印象就是很瘦，总是被主人骂，常常追跑在它主人的车后。突然消失了一段时间，还以为可能被抓狗队抓去了，因为我们这常常都有抓狗队，试过连续三个星期每天都来。去年 日傍晚它突然出现在我们店外，更加瘦了，脚还一拐一拐的，还有那无助的眼神，本以为或者给它一顿饱饭后好回家，它没吃饭，只是躲在一角，我想它应该是需要帮忙了，拖了我的狗笼往它方向走，辛好它的信任只是凶了我一下，没有把我咬。一整晚在笼子里面不吵不闹，就是很不舒服的样子。隔天幹紧把它送给兽医做检查，原来前脚是因为与其它的狗狗打架而化脓了，必须立刻开刀清洗，不然将会因脓毒而身亡。本来想着将它医好还给它主人，我清楚这位顾客并不会替我分担医药费，想着也算了，我只是可怜这毛孩。但是问题来了，从这位顾客朋友口中知道，原来这位主人从来不曾给它饭吃，难怪它那么瘦，更加生气的是工厂的孟加拉工人常常拿铁条往它身上抽，还试过被打得头破血流，难怪我常看见它四处游荡，其实是不敢回家。听后真的很生气，也不可能放它回地狱。兽医也很清楚我的情况与环境，不敢让它载回给我。如今它在兽医处已经超过2个月，住院费也不停的增加中，未知之数。那是因为我已经要照顾23位毛孩，大部分都是我这六年来挽救接近一百只毛孩而未能找到属于它们永远的家的孩子们，身为一位浪浪挽救者，我清楚知道我们所要面对的问题，并非每只都能幸运的找到属于它们的家。出不了的百年归老我们也只好都扛下了。这六年来我都自己照顾着它们，偶尔亲戚朋友的帮助让我减轻一些负担，如今我欠下一屁股债，欠下兽医 3 千多的医疗费，还未包括这毛孩的。幸好我的兽医从来都不曾催我还钱。她很清楚我的环境和能力。兽医只是常常告诉我不要再救了，或者你又扛上身啊！ 哈哈！我就是熬不过自己对毛孩的那分同情心，如果我们不帮它们将会更可怜了。可是一个人的力量实在太有限了。我每天除了要忙咖啡店，父母已经 六十多岁，还要照顾23位毛孩们，我已经没有能力收留照顾更多了。而且我家是咖啡店，还收养了那么多毛孩，被抓狗队吃了不少钱之外，也很担心被投诉，到时除了要被逼关门之外可能还会把我所有的毛孩都抓走，真的很怕。。。除了分享一下我的小故事，我是希望有心人可以帮帮忙让这可怜的毛孩有个休养的地方，或者让它找到一个属于它的家，疼它的主人。医疗费我会想办法，或者慢慢还，现在只想尽快让它出院，好好休养。如果你们可以帮个忙请联络我，感激不尽! 我在 KL 的，我的联络号码 - 谢谢！,5,3
7330,Cat,4,Tabby,Male,Gray,No Color,Small,Short,No,No,Healthy,50,"This is Bubu. He was found in my residential college (Gombak) alone with no siblings or mom in sight. He frequented my room and my neighbours' rooms and we cared for him as much as we could. Bubu has a wound near his mouth (the vet suspected it was from either an insect bite or a kitten fight) and we are currently treating him with antibiotic pills and dressings. All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. 💙❤️ Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did. If you are interested, please PM me or drop a comment below so I can reach out to you.

7453,Cat,5,Tabby,Male,Golden,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Tom was rescued a few weeks ago. He was wandering around outside my friend's office looking for scraps to eat. The scrawny little tyke was skin and bones. He pulled at my friend's heartstrings and she bundled him up in a box to bring to me for fostering. He had a fungal infection and this had made him lose a lot of hair. After weeks of treatment most of it has grown back and he now has a lovely striped orange tabby coat and an elegant long tail. He is long limbed and lean. A white patch on his chest is the extra touch of cuteness that makes him irresistible. Personality-wise, he is very affectionate and playful. He loves attention and cuddles from both humans and other cats alike. Mischevious, he can often be found wrestling with my other cats or stealing food from my dog. Tom loves attention and doesn't like to be alone. It would be great if he could find a home with other cats or perhaps a dog. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tom are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter.

She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken.

6381,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,No Color,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC! Do text or email me. Thanks for viewing her profile. :D",12,3

4872,Cat,18,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Gray,White,Large,Medium,No,Yes,Healthy,0,"This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves.

Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up. He's healthy except for a minor skin problem (probably from the stress of being on the streets on his own). The vet thinks he's about months old only... so he's still a puppy.

He is looking for a good home and family that can love and treat him as part of the family. Husky Boy is still young and need love, patients and attention, so must take care him well. He is very alert and will guard your house faithfully in return for tender loving care (however if you're purely looking for a guard dog who you can tie in your porch all day long to take care of your house, Husky is not for you). He is cute and healthy, playful and very good with humans and other dogs. As he is used to being indoors and loves being around with people and having company. However, if you do have a big compound for him to run and play, he will love it too because he was very active. Terms and conditions for adoption are: 1)MUST be sprayed/neutered (Cost will be considered if sharing required) 2)MUST continue with his annual vaccinations. 3)Only suitable for landed properties as Husky needed a landed property with big compound to move around. 4)MUST NOT be caged or chained for long periods of time. 5)MUST be provided with sufficient shelter from sun and rain. 6)Must have proper food and water for him (No bones allowed) 7)MUST walked him every morning and evening. 8)Must be able to afford veterinary care if he falls ill. 9)Must upkeep monthly tick treatment and Heartgard prevention to prevent tick fever and heartworms (also to prevent tick infestation in your home and transmission of ticks to your family). 10)Not suitable for factory, workshop or farm use. 11)During the stage of adoption, do allow home visit or, email picture or sent what's app picture, so that as a rescuer, I can ensure that Husky Boy is adjustable well to his new environment with his new loving family in his forever home. If you can fulfill the above conditions then you are a suitable and caring adopter for Husky Boy. Please contact me at for more info of the above adoption. “Only serious adopters who can look after Husky Boy himself/herself will be entertained” because as a rescuer, I definitely don’t tolerate ‘Animal Cruelty’ Thank you for your kind consideration and understanding to the above terms and conditions.",2,3

Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry.

906,Cat,12,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Cream,White,Large,Medium,No,No,Healthy,0,"READ BEFORE DECIDING! Mio is an active, playful, and talkative male cat. He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",4,3

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep.

The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds.

The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good!

8732,Cat,29,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,90,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",11,2

4973,Dog,2,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"She's sweet and easy to warm up to pup. Active and likes to engage in play, but is reserved to start. She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size. She has gotten dewormed and done one wash for fleas and ticks, with other vaccinations and a neutering pending with vets advice, as they suggest we wait for her to get a little older.",5,0

We're cooperated with some vet clinics to get discount medical fees for adopted pets. Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding ♥",11,1

I always get what I want, nobody can resist my puppy eyes! I love my cat mummy (seen in picture), my cat brother, Jamie and my little sister Caramel. I love everything! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we found Maple and her sister, Caramel in a basket in front of the 99 speed mart on a wet rainy night (blame the monsoon season). Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them. With Miu miu's help, these babies managed to grow into the bright and spunky puppies they are today! So if you're interested in adopting puppies that were raised by a cat, contact us!

8608,Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Golden,No Color,Large,Medium,No,Yes,Healthy,0,"****************** UPDATE /14 - Simba was neutered today... and will be ready to go to his new family in a week or so... ******************** UPDATE /14: Simba has had a bath and is looking quite handsome now. And he has finally brought his tail out from between his legs and is even wagging his tail! When we picked Simba up, he was really so scared and frightened that his tail was stuck between his legs!Poor thing... I don't normally say mean things, but I hope that his owners rot in hell for abandoning him, for letting him suffer physical and mental stress of living on the streets and fending for himself, for being knocked down by a car and injuring his leg and for being caught by the dog catchers! ******************* /14 This is Simba. He was abandoned by his owners when they shifted out of their house. They just threw him out on the streets. The poor boy waited for them to come back for him and refused to move from that road eventhough it was a very busy road. The neighbours in the area started feeding him and they tried to catch him several times. But he would always evade them. Sometime last week, he was hit by a car and his front leg was injured. Again the people that were feeding him tried to catch him but to no avail. And then one idiotic and heartless neighbour decided to report him to the council (saying that he was a dangerous dog although he kept to himself and was just waiting for his family) and poor Simba got caught. The people feeding him called me and asked me to help get him out. Thankfully I managed to claim him back from the council. But Simba was petrified when we went to get him out. He couldn't move. He was frozen with fear. There were lots of other dogs there that had been caught and I know that this is the case with all the council pounds. I wish I could have taken them all, but I couldn't... :( It took us quite a while to finally get him out but we finally succeeded. We brought him back to my place and it took over an hour before he finally realised that he was safe. He had a good sleep, probably the first time he slept peacefully since he was abandoned. He will be going to vet today and I would be grateful if one of you could help foster him while he recovers from his injury, and while I look for a new forever home for him. He will not do well being boarded as he is quite a timid dog... We could look after him ourselves but we already have way too many animals... Please call me if you can help foster this lovely boy. I will take care of all medical expenses and food bills etc. I just need a home environment where he can rest and regain his faith in humans. Or better still, if you can give him a forever home that he deserves, that will be even better. Please SMS or WhatsApp me at if you can either foster or adopt Simba. If you can't, please help share this so that Simba will have a better chance of getting a home. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION: 1. Must not be caged or chained unnecessarily. 2. Must be given clean shelter from the heat and rain. 3. Must be fed proper food and be given access to water at all times. 4. Must be given medical care and attention when necessary. 5. Will only be released to the adopter after neutering. ********************** PS: If you ever lose your dog, please call all the nearby councils and insist that you want to go and check their pounds cause sometimes they will just say that they didn't catch any dogs in a particular area. Your dog could be waiting for you helplessly! And you should check immediately on the day you lost the dog and the subsequent days after that. Cause sometimes they may not be taken to the pound immediately.",8,3

7066,Cat,7,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Yellow,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Hi everyone! Here is Sandy! She is a 6/7 months old female cat. We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",9,3

9627,Cat,4,Maine Coon,Male,Yellow,Cream,Large,Long,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Introducing dashing little Ferauni! ♥ Male kitten, 4 months old (D.O.B: ). Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you!",7,1

4021,Dog,12,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him. May God bless you.",10,3

She is a perfect candidate for a family guarding dog because she can protect the house and her territory as she can warn owners of nearby strangers approaching. She can be very friendly if approached gently. She is very active when going out and enjoys hikes and adventurous walks. Joos has been to hikes to waterfalls and top of mountains and she responds very well to adventure in the jungle. Because of her dominant behaviour and strong character only experienced adopters will be considered as she needs a strong leader that she can rely on. Only calm and assertive adopters are recommended. I can no longer keep Joos because I have too many dogs and I cannot continue to foster her.

All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow. Please help us to continue helping other abandoned and stray animals.",2,4
