9924,Dog,7,Labrador Retriever,Female,White,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"I've had Angel for a year now, and know all Angel's good traits as below: 1) Once Angel trusts you, she will be a loving and loyal pet, who will greet you VERY excitedly when you come home (even if gone for 5 minutes!). Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",6,4

Unfortunately, because of this her history is unknown. The vet is unsure of her exact age but puts her between 6-7 years old.

Took her in, care for her till she is healthy and fluffy now. She is a very active and obedient dog. Ready for a forever home. Loves the outdoor, will follow you off leash and is very submissive. We always enjoy our walks & runs with her. Understands basic command like, Sit, Wait, and Come.We took the time and trained her to wait for her food. Only eats it when we say 'OK' . Super adorable! Fast learner, if you like training your dogs, she is definitely for you. Always focus waiting for instruction. Smaller than a medium size dog. We are just guessing that she have GSD mix from her long nose and big ears, also maybe lil Husky mix because of her fluffy husky-like tail and the rest we will have to continue guessing. Treats and food are her favs. hahah! Extremely affectionate. Love attention. Literally toilet trained. If leave outdoor, she does her business on grass. If indoor, she will do it in the toilet. She is in need of a forever home urgently. Message me now for more details. Vaccinated once. Adopter must agree to spay & continue her vaccination. Also no leashing her up or cage for long hours .

Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath. I was unable to care for this puppy for long time as i'm staying at a apartment and i have a 9 months old female mongrel dog with me, which i rescue her 6 months ago when her owner decided to leave her alone by the road side. To my surprise my female dog seems to enjoy the male puppy company, well maybe they share the same fate as a mongrel and stray around by the roadside and so my female dog decided to treat the small male puppy nice. The puppy was a very active dog, he likes to follow me around where ever i go and when i keep him in a cage or when he does not see me around for a short period of time he whine and whine until he fall asleep.

The nice lady posted flyers around the area and asked all the Puchong vets about me but after 3 weeks no one has claimed me.

I'm good with other dogs and like playing with small to medium dogs. I have sensitive skin so I hope my human will feed me a good quality diet. I do my potty on the grass or near drainhole covers - my carer thinks I was previously an indoor dog and perhaps potty trained to wee in the bathroom :) Since my past is unknown, I haven't been sent for neutering but please do the responsible thing and spay me after I go on heat if that happens. I'd really like to spend many happy days cuddling on the couch with someone who will tickle my ears and kiss my little apple head - are you the one for me?"" Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3.

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate.",5,1

6151,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,White,Small,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",4,1

1458,Dog,6,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,No Color,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Hi, My name is GLEE and I’m full of glee. That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t. So I hope to have a loving home to go to – where I can bring life, joy and glee to my new family. I hope we meet soon!",2,3

I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me).

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",9,1

But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA.

2543,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,White,Small,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,65,"20 September update: Roma has been adopted by Li of Kajang! Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.

9770,Cat,4,Persian,Male,Gray,No Color,Large,Medium,No,No,Healthy,120,"This beautiful mix-Persian kitten has soft, fluffy grey fur (dense undercoat) and a long tail. The most remarkable thing about him is his very sweet and beautiful face. What makes him more special though is that his personality mirrors his face: he is sweet, gentle and affectionate (manja). He will rush after you to play and be stroked and cuddled. He is very well-trained with cat litter and is a good and obedient cat (not overly playful or boisterous). He will grow up to be a very handsome and large cat (following his persian side) because even now he is bigger than most domestic kittens his age. I hope to find him a good, loving home with people who will love him and can give him good quality cat food and chicken meat (his favourite :)as well as the ability to afford a vet visit if neccessary. Pls note: I must be honest and emphasize that he is a very fussy eater. He doesn't like cat biscuits and will only eat canned food if mixed with boiled chicken or fish meat. And not given the food he likes he will hardly eat and grow thin. He also has a sensitive stomach and if not given quality food (that means no table scraps) he will have diarrhoe. Despite all this his beauty, his playfulness and his very affectionate personality makes me hard to part with him but if you feel you can give him a better home...pls contact me. The money you pay for him is not for me to profit but will go a long way to help the other cats under my care.",5,3

5849,Cat,3,Tabby,Female,Brown,Cream,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Little Stacey was a stray kitten that had been wandering the streets for roughly a week. I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

6008,Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,Gray,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"2-year old male mixed breed Rosco up for adoption! Neutered, dewormed, vaccinated. Gorgeous mix of colours. He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead! Please PM me if you want to adopt this darling and help share and spread the word to anyone you know who's had dogs, but doesn't have one at the moment and wants one and only one now :)",1,2

Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

2035,Cat,8,Siamese,Male,Black,White,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him.

I play with my other cat friends and dog friends and my human too. I love everyone, any shape or size! I enjoy spending time with my human, sometimes just chilling on the bed with them until we all fall asleep. and then we'll wake up and I'll get my morning dose of rubs *pur pur pur* and then we'll have breakfast together! __________________ Backstory: Dexter was rescued with his little sister, Luna in front of shop lots when they were a baby and still feeding on milk (still not ready for solids). That was why we had no choice but to take them into our care or else their fate would be sealed. Dexter have been kept indoors since we took him in and slowly introduced to different rooms by us. We train all our foster cats to be indoor because of the uncertainties of being outdoor. he is very obedient and knows how to sit. We have trained him to sit every time before we feed him. He is one smart cookie! Please Whatsapp Kelly at 0 1 6 2 1 3 3 6 7 8",1,0

3111,Dog,60,Pit Bull Terrier,Male,Brown,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,300,"We took Mikey in when he was found looking lost on the road. He appeared to be someone's pet as he was clean and neat. We later found out that he was left behind with two other dogs when his owner moved out. Mikey is friendly to human however he is territorial and doesn't enjoy mixing with other dogs/cats. He is a good guard dog and extremely alert. Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required. If you are interested, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) Neutering and vaccination has been done. We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Mike cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. If you're interested to adopt Mikey, leave your comments below or contact me.

11382,Dog,17,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Chance was rescued by my housemate from a hit and run near our house a few months ago. Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper. We have about a quarter of a 20kg bag of dog food, treats, a leash, a chain, water and food bowl to give away as well. We just want Chance to find a loving home where he can be happy.",3,4

Just like my sister, I am adventurous and very loving (we got this trait from our mummy). We love people and being around people, and playing with people and snuggling up to people, anything people related! Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!",2,2

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09. We're so pleased!",15,2

3518,Dog,54,Pomeranian,Male,Brown,Cream,Small,Medium,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Found this lost Pomeranian in my neighborhood. He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property?

He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs.

9162,Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Golden,Cream,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,80,"Ara needs a forever home! Believe me, he's a really sweet guy! Here's his story: Ara was found along Jalan Cempaka in Kg Sg Kayu Ara on 18th April, , with a wire cable wrapped tightly around his left hind leg. It had cut almost to the bone and rendered the leg useless. He was rescued and taken to a vet. Thankfully, as Ara was rescued early enough, there was no infection and the leg was saved. It is now almost healed and there does not appear to be any long-term damage to it. In fact, Ara is now able to put his weight on the leg and run, jump (he is an amazing jumper!), and play just like any other dog. Ara was at a fosterer’s since 21st April, , but his resources are stretched as he has his own dog. Therefore, he has since been sent to PAWS Animal Welfare Society on 3rd June . Between the vet and the fosterer, Ara’s mild case of tick fever was also addressed. We urge any kind soul to adopt Ara and bring him home with you. He's a well-mannered and friendly dog with a penchant for playing with balls and shuttlecocks. He is easy to bathe and walk and is good with children, including young ones. From his behaviour and mannerisms, Ara was likely someone else’s pet before, but he is also very street smart now, no doubt due to his time as a stray. Please give Ara a home if you can. We really hope he doesn’t have to go back to being a stray. Thank you for your consideration, and please share! You may visit him at PAWS. Please quote his tag number as listed next to his name at the top of this page to the staff at PAWS. PAWS Animal Welfare Society Pilmoor Estate, Subang Airport Road, Subang, Selangor, Malaysia",20,4

She is so friendly and loving and so unbelievably cute. Sadly we already have a male rescue kitten who's much older and bigger and they are not gelling well at all, so she's being kept in a smaller room and she deserves to be in a safe home where she can run around free. When I took her to the vet on Monday 29th May they said to wait a week to have her first vaccination, so I'm taking her back for this on Monday 5th June. She'll then need to go back for her second vaccination a month after that so if you take her before then you'll need to do this. Then of course she'll need her spaying when she's at least 6 months old, she's only 7 weeks old right now.

2124,Cat,3,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Gray,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Hello, Max-A-Million here! ♥ My rescue story is a rough one. I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it!

8451,Dog,11,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Cooper and his two sisters were rescued from a parking lot in Ara Damansara early this year. He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

Good thing I was able to separate them or she would have been a goner. Still a cheerful pup despite the incident but fearful at times. Maybe that's why she went bonkers and fought with B1 in the middle of the night on 30/9/17. First time I see pups fight like adult dogs.

5882,Dog,12,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,White,Medium,Long,Not Sure,Not Sure,Minor Injury,0,"We rescued her from a park in USJ2. It had been raining heavily nonstop when we discovered her by chance. She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced.

He brought up 3 siblings when I rescued them age 1 month old. Now they are 5 months old and ready for adoption. ""October"" nurse them and thanks to ""October"" these 3 siblings survive without a mummy. ********************************************* I picked up October 09 (as u can see thats the time I picked him)at a market place at Sri Gombak. This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

According to the people around, he has been there for 2-3 days. We rushed Eaton to the nearby vet where he was given intensive care. As a result of the ties, there are ligature marks on all his four legs. Eaton is now recovering and we are seeking for animal lover to open their heart for Eaton. Eaton is timid due to the way he was treated. Once he gained your trust, he will be your best buddy. We are not charging any adoption fee as all we hope is for the adopter to care and love Eaton. Goodwill donation is welcomed to ease our medical fee burden. To qualify you to own Eaton, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. If you are below 18 years old, we will require your parents to speak with us on the adoption procedure. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 4) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 5) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive her progress update. 6) During the intial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Eaton is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 7) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Eaton cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. 8) We reserve all rights to remove Eaton from you if he is found to be neglected under your care. If you're interested to adopt Eaton, please contact me by sms, e-mail or call. Provide us your details (particular, type of house and experience with dogs).",1,3

He had a slight back injury which he still carries that makes him walk like he has too much to drink, but he is as healthy as can be. He is as active and playful as any cat (except when he wants to be lazy). He loves the company of people. If you bond with him, he will follow you everywhere: he'll laze around and watch tv with you, hang out in the study when you're working, and if you let him, he'll even cuddle up with you in bed. We are hoping someone loving will adopt him as we live in an apartment and will be having our first child soon. There won't be enough space as well as attention. We will pass on all of his kitty stuff: litter box, pet carrier etc. This would be a good pet for those first time owners as well.

7109,Dog,6,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"I love Guana alot. Guana Description: 1) She is very active, she likes to run alot. So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately. I am Sorry to all that is reading this, because I could not continue taking care of her as my work will get even busier in the weeks to come. Hope a Genuine good adopter will take Guana in to their family (prefer people with dog(s) already, I dont want her to be lonely).",13,3

So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage.

My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human.

So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call .

I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end.

Blue-coated tuxedo with thick fur and hazel eyes. ♥ Rambunctious & frisky boy! LOVES to play & run about (needs toys, kitty companions or some kind of constant stimulation). Active households are his perfect cup of tea! Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off). Mind you he has a VERY loud purr! ♥ Maksim is healthy, has been de-wormed (once) and given Frontline (flea medication). Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to ""play"" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips. This is only play-biting and a simple ""shh!"" makes him stop immediately. :) He is a very smart kitten and for this reason, experienced cat owners are preferred. - Maksim must be kept INDOORS at all times and NEUTERED at the right age (adopters who already practice neutering their cats preferred). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

I strayed too far from home a few weeks ago and got lost. I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ♥ I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ♥ Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ♥ Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ♥ I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ♥ I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ♥ I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ◘ Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. ◘ Adoption fees will apply (to cover is neutering & vaccination cost). Please inquire. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take this lad home, please drop me an email or text at my number.

I am unable to take care of so many cats as I'm always out of house due to work so I'm looking for kind, caring people to take care of them and want to have their own cats as pets as soon as possible. The 2nd one is Duzell, the only female of the bunch. She's very playful and loves to follow you around once she gets close to you. Her colour is not too black and has a hint of gray. She has a pair of 'white stockings' on her back legs which makes her look even cuter. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Duzell can already use the litter box like her brothers, so she is toilet trained and won't make too much mess. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me.

Give her a plastic bag and she'll have a whole night of fun. She's also toilet trained. However, Long Ling is not perfect. She is afraid of strangers at first, but warms up gradually and then becomes affectionate after some time. We have rescued other cats before and she doesn't like them.

There were only 2 remaining when I tried to get them adopted through Petfinder but failed for months as they were highly afraid of humans and fled into an opening whenever I tried to get closer, probably due to the constant abuse, threats and beatings from the restaurant workers. I could always hear them crying out in pain/fear from my home. Sadly I believe her brother was bludgeoned to death. There was nothing I could do until one day during a heavy downpour which flooded her place of refuge, I found her at my doorstep. We have been fostering her and can finally post her up for adoption after 2 weeks of getting her to trust and adapt to humans. She is still cautious and slightly fearful but we managed to give her a bath and continue building her confidence. Hope to find her a good home soon so she can be loved and cared for. She's smart and cheerful too and I'm sure you will enjoy having her as part of your family.

10779,Dog,24,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Brown,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Rex was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace. The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

His fur is medium length and quite fluffy. He also has a very long and elegant tail. Personality wise he is a sweetheart. Very affectionate (manja), no matter how I shoo him away he keeps on coming begging to be given attention :) and he is also obedient, he listened when I said he can't come into the house. Therefore, despite being so manja he is also very independent. I'm looking for someone to give him a loving forever home that he obviously so desperately craves for.

8155,Dog,12,Mixed Breed,Female,Golden,Cream,Medium,Medium,No,No,Minor Injury,0,"Bambi was found in the middle of the road in Segambut in the evening (near KTM Segambut) and was pushed to the roadside by a kind man. At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying.

When I approached him, I realised he could not stand as his right leg was injured. Managed to transport him to the Vet. X ray showed that he suffers from pelvic bone and tail bone fracture. The pelvic bone fracture, according to the vet, will heal by itseslf but the tail may have to be amputated. There WAS no anal tone, hence he couldn't control his bowel movement. Currently he is still in the animal hospital and besides conventional treatment, he is also undergoing acupuncture treatment. I am so happy to hear from the vet few days ago that the anal tone is coming back. So this mean the possibility of him regaining control of his bowel movement is very high. He is a very clean conscious dog. Keeps on licking himself and can paw whenever you extend your hand! He will give the other paw when u ask for ""Another Paw""! The potential owner has to be very committed as it may be quite messy if the treatment is not successful.

Learnt to sit in a day, wait for food in 2 days. Will poo in grass whenever possible. Excellent temperament, very manja with humans and playful with dogs.

4184,Dog,10,Irish Wolfhound,Female,Black,White,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Introducing Kayla! _________________________________________________ Details: ♥ Female, 10 months old, Irish Wolfhound + Border Collie mix. She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home. Details on your past experience with dogs will be much appreciated. Thank you!",6,2

6959,Dog,96,Cocker Spaniel,Female,Brown,Cream,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Hi there. Call me Lady, or as my foster mama calls me, Lady Smellanor. She thinks it’s funny. I don’t. I hate this name. That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name… like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me. I’ll be waiting…",11,0

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy.

10430,Cat,5,Tabby,Female,Cream,Gray,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,150,"Chloe is a little white/cream/gray kitten found alone across a big main road at night, attracting the dogs of the entire neighbourhood who were all barking at her, especially our own rescue dog. When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times.

Apparently, the virus is very strong as it's the rainy season now. I'm on medication, am getting much better, although I am really bad with taking my pills. :P I like to eat but I am more of a gourmet kitty rather than a gourmand as I will firstly, take a deep breath (hmmm...there's just something about the smell of sardines and mackerel fish), gently nibble and then, slowly savour my food till I clean my plate.

6617,Cat,4,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,White,No Color,Large,Medium,No,No,Healthy,0,"Yota was found by my mom as this little kitten was stuck in her car (specifically, the engine compartment). We found out that he was there by his extremely vocal expressions. We called out to him and he crawled out onto my hand like a child reaching out to feel a mother's touch for the first time. He was named after the car which was a Toyota; Thus Yota. When we found him, he was so skinny and was crawling from parasites. Fast forward to a month later, he is an active kitten with a doggy best friend/big sister. He is very vocal, very active, and definitely very brave. At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over. This kitten is super cute and is a super sweet heart. If you adopt him into your family, I only have 2 conditions: 1) to love, take care, and provide him the freedom to be the active lil kitty he is; 2) to have him spayed by his 5th month of age. I wish to visit him again when he is in his 5th month to ensure that that is done. Thanks for reading to this point. Enjoy his cute pictures and I hope you get to enjoy his cute shenanigans.",5,2

Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",3,2

Meet Jack the Peanut, one of two surviving pups available for adoption. Born on 3rd-April-, there were initially about 5-6 pups but the rest mysteriously disappeared over the first 2 weeks. Nicknamed peanut because of how tiny it actually was when born into the world. It's still rather tiny when compared to his sister. Jack has a slight case of skin problem on the right hind leg & a couple of tiny patches on the body. Probably due to falling into the dirty drains one too many times. We have been applying Arnica Compound Gel on the affected area and it seems to be doing wonders. The fur seems to be growing back nicely. Jack the Peanut & Jill the Walnut had their first bath last week and are still looking fluffy. 3 new pics have been updated to the profile (26-5-13). Just noticed that Jack has a unique chest 'emblem'... the Union Jack. To those curious on how the parents look like, take a sneak peek at",8,2

Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time!

She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang.

She is a large cat with very striking tabby markings and a bold personality to match! I work at Zoo Negara and sadly we have a lot of people dumping pets at the zoo.

Kate is one of these cats, and is looking for a ""forever"" home where she can share her love and affection with an understanding owner. I estimate she is around one year old, and she was caught along with two kittens which are also up for adoption (same tabby stripe markings, also up for adoption). Although she has not been vaccinated/ dewormed/ spayed yet, all of these will be done if you agree to adopt her. She has a full tail.

Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",9,2

10186,Dog,12,Shih Tzu,Male,Brown,Cream,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"To the kind person taking the time to read this, My name is Oreo and I'm just over one year old, male, pure Shih Tzu. I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",11,1

She is a good, alert watch dog, does not simply bark except for times when stranger is near the house. Understand basic commands like 'sit down', 'come here ' and when to start eating her food, does not bite things or shoes Advantage of adopting adult dog vs puppy: - Adult dogs are mature and character shown, as not all dogs have the character to watch a house (welcoming to all strangers without being alert), however Jolly is an alert watch dog that does not give in to people she is not familiar with. A good watch dog only works well if is not tie up or cage up whole day. - Adult dogs do not chew/ destroy things, not hyperactive or run around as compare to puppies - Female dog does not pee all around the house. They have set boundary for 'pee & poo' area - Adult dogs are more loving, easy to command as compared to puppy, and at this age, they would sit near to you just to watch you doing your things (they love companionship) Me and my husband love her very much, she has kept us feeling safe every night and she is a good company.

6507,Dog,7,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,No Color,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Estee is part of a trio of puppies born to a pair of stray dogs near our house. Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.",6,3

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed). As for Nova, he is 4 months old, male, not spay yet. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

He had extra time and feeds from us and remarkably within a week, began blooming and catching up. He's still a midget today compared to his siblings! The most independent and inquisitive boy, he loves strokes and being shown around the house. He follows our feet everywhere! Loves sitting on our laps to watch things (whenever he chooses and not while he's busy playing, of course!). ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

When it grew big, and they have a baby sitting business in the house, they decided to abandon it. And they abandoned it right outside their house. However, the loyal dog slept outside their house for months, rain or shine, hoping to get back in. It grew thinner day by day, until I decided to take it in.

She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

6687,Cat,14,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Black,Brown,Medium,Medium,No,Yes,Healthy,200,"My people kept many of us. We were all semi long haired. I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl’s voice. “Aiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.” She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. “Pity they are all short haired” said the girl. “The mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.” I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. “She is falling ill.” “Crap, what about the kittens?” “Not yet. But they will.” I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. “Her name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‘fruitful woman’ because she takes care of so many ” I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. “Shit! Two more in a box” said Olivia. “Tallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise” decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. “AIKS!” I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, “I must try.”",1,4
1759,Dog,2,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"On the 2/1/, while i was parking my car for work i stumble a female mongrel dog together with 6 puppies lying on a deserted house opposite subang airport. The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. There are 6 more puppies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption.",15,3

It saddens me to know that people DO NOT READ the pet's condition before agreeing to adopt. Brothers and sisters, please know that adopting a dog is really taking full responsibility for a life of another and is a serious matter. Placing a dog in different homes especially with his condition is already stressful enough for him. Please sit down and think before agreeing to give this poor boy a new home. Thank you. ********************************** I adopted Samba back in and was informed that he had been abused during the four years that he was being taken cared of. He was caged most of the time and according to the doctor he was also beaten. Samba is an extremely gentle and loyal dog, and will follow you everywhere you go. He does not like being left alone, and is ONLY kept indoors. He is extremely afraid of loud noises especially when it is raining or when there are fireworks. Samba is also potty trained, and needs to go for his walks as frequent as possible. Unless you have a backyard in which he is able to go to the toilet then he needs his daily walks at least once a day. It would be great if I can find him a good home, someone who has A LOT, A LOT of patience. Kindly contact me through here if interested.",1,4

84,Dog,120,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Brown,Large,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"I am posting this on my lecturer's behalf. She found this stray dog in her neighbourhood at Sungai Buloh. He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed. He is very obedient & easy to care for. This precious angel has gone through a lot & really needs a loving home.",3,4

3985,Dog,5,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Brown,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Little Hailey had a rough beginning to her life. Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.",3,4

6000,Cat,4,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Black,White,Medium,Medium,No,No,Healthy,0,"If your cat is lonely, here is the perfect solution: a cat who loves other cats. BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months.

When she was rescued, Miskin was filthy, scared and desperately hungry. A week later, she is now a confident, affectionate and beautiful little kitten. She has been bathed and de-flead.

1090,Cat,2,American Curl,Male,Cream,White,Medium,Long,Yes,No,Healthy,400,"♥ Male, 8 weeks old, white cream point with blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Christian is both a rambunctious player and a shy little love-dove! He is careful of new situations as much as he tests them, and once he warms up, he can skip over at his humans better than the fastest bunny. He's our favourite boy and it took a lot of heart to place him for adoption - heavy purrer (he'll sound like an engine!) and especially loves being stroked and kissed while carried. He can be a lap-cat when relaxing (not while he's busy playing of course, he'll jump off). Also enjoys being shown around the house. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Christian must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",14,3

She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",8,1

Princess is healthy with blood test done, e canis test and heartworm test done. Princess has been through a lot and was abandoned and starved for a few days before rescued by other rescuers. She was later re-homed to someone who passed her to someone else when moving away. The adopter tied her up 24/7 and bred her. They refused to spay her.

Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me.

She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too.

3817,Cat,12,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Gray,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",12,2

5481,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Golden,Cream,Medium,Medium,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Introducing Noel! This girl has a beautiful white coat with bright orange patches. Oh, and hazel green eyes to die for! Rescued on a rainy Christmas afternoon at a street junction in Petaling (Friday). After a brief moment of petting, the darling decided simply to 'adopt' us, she kept tagging along wherever we went. (It's like she knew it HAD to be me, that i'd finally give in to such temptations and take her with me). I can be such a kitty magnet at times... This lady is extremely sweet and manja. I don't think she's had much attention from anyone during her life on the streets. Thus, i'd prefer it if she's able to go to a new home where she'd have other kitts to play around with...either that or lots and LOTS of human attention :] She's able to take solids already (currently on RC Kitten diet) and is clever with the litterbox. If you would like to give this girl a good, loving home, please contact me or drop me an e-mail. Details on your past experiences with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you!",7,2

She is super lovely, affectionate, very tamed but an intelligent watch dog. She is not a pedigree, but she is equally great.

Then, her family left Malaysia… and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",5,3

He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt. I would inquire some details from you to understand your request for a pet.",6,2

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is named Saffron or Saffy for short. I named this batch after spices haha. At first she seemed meek but she's actually really friendly and curious and likes to walk and run around. She takes after her mother, Mimi. Saffy might need to be introduced to food slowly as she doesn't eat as much as her sibling, so be prepared with some kitten milk just in case and then give her wet food and slowly some dried ones. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me.

Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come.

Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him.

She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare.

But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can.

7341,Cat,3,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,59,"A Malay neighbour asked for my help to rehome Murphy and she has be raising him for 2 months after her children rescued him. - He has a long tail and no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - He was dewormed by a vet on 2 September . - He was vaccinated on 2 September at a cost of RM59. - He was Frontline-sprayed on 2 September to protect him against fleas for about a month. - His weight is 1.47 kg as at 2 September . - I'm feeding him with premium dry cat kibbles (Evo - Turkey & Chicken Formula). - He can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using premium scoopable cat litter (Ever Clean). - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - His behaviour: He's domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Murphy, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.",4,2

He could have been abandoned as he was found without a collar. According to one of the residents, she and her neighbour have been feeding him for the past one week. My husband bumped into him a couple of nights ago when “Fluffy” approached him. We have been feeding him dinner as other times, he went gallivanting and probably found his own meals. “Fluffy” is obviously domesticated which makes him sociable & approachable. He is sweet, affectionate and playful. We would love to keep him (it’s hard not to when he gives us that cute look!) but we already have 3 cats of our own. We think “Fluffy” may be less than a year old, may have been neutered and toilet-trained. We would love to see “Fluffy” find a new loving home where he truly belongs and make sure he'll be in good health. It would be a great waste to let him wander into danger and death. Notes: 1. We appreciate SERIOUS and COMMITTED adopters. If you're below 21yo, please get your parents' consent before writing to me. 2.

6184,Dog,27,Beagle,Male,Black,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"He puts up a front and acts mean in front of strangers but in actual fact, is a lovable and well-meaning dog. It all depends on how you approach him. He generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. He's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. If not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. If you do intend to adopt him, I think it would be best to channel has energies by enrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. He likes to play fetch with a ball and I like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. He knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. Though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey! He needs a firm, stable, cool-headed and knowledgable ""pack leader"" that will give him the EDA (Exercise, Discipline, Affection) that I currently can't afford to give him.

My friend took her in. Fed her, took her to the vet. They got medicine and now she's brand new. My friend thinks that she did have a loving caring home, but the owners kicked her out. (considering she was surprisingly great with children) She has been having mood swings. As if she cannot trust humans anymore... :-( she had a mental breakdown and bit my friend two other German Shepards. She has gotten better and she knows how to control her moods. But do be aware that this poor girl has been through ALOT of stuff. So she has just gotten used to trusting humans again. please, please do try and think about this!! She is in need of a home very badly and she needs a SPECIAL loving home that can care for her for the rest of her life.

5736,Dog,120,Labrador Retriever,Female,Yellow,Cream,Large,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,Serious Injury,0,"'Old doesn't make one redundant'...This is the story of a special girl with every loving name. She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin",4,2

She was looking very weak and exhausted. So told her to stay there, raced the kids back and got Nicole Lee Suresh to come with me to get her out. We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs).

I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you.",7,3

Tess has a lovely strong tabby stripe, soft fur and a long graceful tail. She likes to prance around and show off. Super easy and litter box trained on her own. She seems to so far only like dry cat food and the occasional chicken meat as a ""treat"". So she is very easy to care for!

My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet.

Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) ◘ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you! :)",10,1

They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

6072,Cat,36,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Gray,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"Mr CrankyPants is one of the cats in a feral colony that my neighbor and I care for. Unlike the others, he has become extremely tame and affectionate. While this is nice for us caretakers, it has made our sweet boy vulnerable to abuse. We suspect he has been intentionally harmed at least twice. Once he suffered a terrible wound on his chest that looked like he had been scalded with boiling water. More recently he became very ill and we think he was poisoned. Our neighbors have been complaining about the stray cats because they are pampered losers with nothing better to do with their lives. In light of these things against our little Cranks, it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to put him up for adoption. We love him but we are both full with our own pet cats and foster animals at the moment. I cannot afford to give him the quality of life that he so deserves and the attention that he craves. I think Mr CrankyPants would get along best as an only cat, or with a spayed female cat. I say this because he does not get along with the other male cats in the feral colony but he is just fine with the females. What's special about Cranks? Sure, he looks like an ordinary grey tabby but his personality is one in a million. He is the sweetest, most affectionate, and attention-seeking cat I have ever met and believe me I've met a lot of cats! He loves giving cuddles as much as he loves receiving them. When he has bonded to someone, he can't get enough of their love and he is never finished affectionately butting his head on you and expressing his gratitude. This cuddlebunny used to be the king of the colony but now he's a teddy bear. He's already been neutered and is healthy and toilet-trained. All that's left now is to find him his perfect human match. Could that be you? Would you like a kitty as sweet, loving, and loyal as a dog? Then Cranks is the one for you. Email or text me if you're interested. More pictures coming soon! He's pretty hard to photograph because he can't sit still! He's constantly rubbing his head on me and being super duper manja. Please, no caging except in instances of illness of injury. Cranks is a free spirit and he loves exploring.",6,4

10983,Cat,5,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Golden,White,Small,Medium,No,No,Healthy,150,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",30,2

After falling very ill with tick fever and being attacked and mauled by the strays in the area, Stan and his wife decided she had to get of the streets. I am fostering Lassie and she has been with me for about 2 months. She loves other dogs and will have no trouble going to a family with other dogs. She will chase nervous cats but does not hurt them. Confident cats who stand their ground get their due respect. She is beautiful; I think a cross between Border Collie and Labrador. She learns fast and is eager to please. She is calm indoors but can walk and run for hours if you're the active type. She may knock small children over with her enthusiasm but there isn't an ounce of malice in her and this will subside with age. Moreover she prefers to snuggle up and nap with her people. If you can provide an indoor home, regular walks and exercise, patience to train her and occasional treats AND You are looking for a unique and beautiful family pet who will love you unreservedly, please get in touch at #adoptdontshop #adoptme #adoptionsaveslives #yoycantbuylove #foradoption",2,3

Though he is quite a talker, he is friendly and will warm up to you once you get close to him. They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. D-Trick can already use the litter box, so he is toilet trained and won't make messes.

We can't keep him because, as mentioned earlier, we already have a dog and our house compound is not adequate to house 2 dogs. Boy has a ruddy bark, bright eyes, golden-brown fur and a calm but alert disposition. Another rescuer agrees with me that Boy is an abandoned dog.

8904,Dog,8,Mixed Breed,Female,Golden,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,0,"In February this year I was alerted to 7 abandoned puppies in my area. With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL.",8,1

370,Dog,5,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,No Color,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,100,"Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",5,4

11050,Dog,4,Labrador Retriever,Female,Black,White,Large,Medium,Yes,No,Healthy,200,"Hi! My name is Melody. I am about 4 months old. I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

Valentine is a bold, lively, playful little boy who loves to snuggle and play with his toy. He is very sweet and affectionate with a lovely stripey coat - very attractive. He is fine with other cats - wants to play with my existing cats (unfortunately they don't want to play with him!).

3754,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Gray,Small,Short,Yes,No,Minor Injury,0,"He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g.

On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada.

She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home.

Anything I shall update you all again :) Below is a snippet of my previous post : -------------------------------------------------- Molly is a happy dog. She is active, loves kids, loves adults, basically just anyone she can play with. She is alert against strangers approaching the house, hence a good guard dog. She is friendly towards anyone near to her owner, hence a good friend. She is friendly towards every member of the house, hence a good house dog. She is toiler trained. She can do it on grass and newspapers. She is obedient, and manja. She never bites. She is happy when people are around. I have been having her since she was 2 months old, and I grew her up in the condominium. She doesnt bark all day, and doesnt simply bark. She only barks when people and cats are around. She is a perfect dog everywhere. She sits still in cars, and doesnt jump around. She is a good passenger too. I love her very very much. Its very very sad to leave her for adoption, but I have no choice. I have to move to a house where no dogs are allowed. All places I asked do not allow dogs. I have no idea how. I really wish someone with a good heart for dogs can take her in. She is up for adoption from today onwards. January is the dateline and I have not found any friends who wants to take in another dog, as they are either occupied with dogs at their home , or they are afraid of dogs. Please contact me if you are interested. ------------------------------------------------",3,4

We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)",2,4

9232,Dog,3,Belgian Shepherd Malinois,Male,Black,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Hello everyone, this is Bolt. We took him out from the pound. He just got into the pound earlier that day and was very traumatized as he was been dragged by the noose. I was only able to bail him out from his other three siblings. Reason was because as the cage door opened, this little guy decided to run for his life. He was very fast hence I named him Bolt. Initially, he was afraid of humans as he was dragged by the pound guys by the noose. Now, he has managed to break out of his shell of fear and deemed free of all those dangerous diseases one can find in a dog from the pound. Vaccinated and dewormed. This little guy is full of life and deserves a forever safe home. Please do contact me if you are interested. Please call and not whatsapp or SMS if you are a serious adopter. There will be a series of questions asked all because we would like to ensure that the potential adopter will be the right one for Bolt. Thanks",3,1

8996,Dog,8,Bull Terrier,Male,Brown,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,120,"[Adopted 17 November by Lawrence T] ""I'm a cute young standard English bull terrier with lots of love to give. I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself including location - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :) SERIOUS ENQUIRIES ONLY. To prove that you have read and understood the listing including the information I have requested, please include this in the body of your email: ""I have read Chabee's listing properly and am fully aware of his issue with destructive chewing. Despite this, I am prepared to prevent or manage such behaviour."" Emails that do not provide info requested will not be entertained.",10,2

One of the reasons why we did not let her stray anymore is because she comes into our compound regularly and mixes with our 2 home cats. We did not want her to be sick when she roams around outside and infect the kitties at home. However, it's been almost half a year that she's staying with us now but have not been able to get along well with the the kitties at home (she's quite active and playful but they are not, which makes the environment quite stressful sometimes for all of them). So, we hope that someone with great patience would be able to adopt her and give her forever home that she can be herself without any barriers.

The car was about to reverse and run over her when we spotted her and ran to stop the car from moving. We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life. She loves to play and snuggle with you on the floor and is still the same happy go lucky girl she always was, always ready to greet you with a smile and a tail wag.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to ""help"" us). ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it.

He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo.

So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",4,4

She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back.

I am very handsome with a very long tail, I am charming, very affectionate and I love children. A funny thing happened one day ...... I went to my home but no-one was there!!! I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!!

7751,Dog,4,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,White,Medium,Medium,Yes,No,Minor Injury,0,"Hi there, my name is Little Dragon. I’m a 4-month old boy. My mum gave birth at the underground car park of an apartment, that’s how me and my siblings were brought to the world, there are 12 of us. Not long after that, my mum was diagnosed with cervical cancer, fortunately she survived after four chemotherapy treatments. And here is my little story. Not long after I was born, I met with an accident and suffered serious concussion, I was wounded with 3 holes in my little head.. Because of that, while all my siblings started to walk I had difficulty to even stand up. In addition to that, I have blurred vision, my cranial nerves were hurt by the accident I suppose.. I have no idea when I’ll recover, maybe it will stay like that forever. Luckily, after 2 months of medication, I’m able to stand and walk now, although I stumbled from time to time. My temporary caretaker has difficulty to keep for me long, I hope that I could meet with a kind master through Facebook. I know people may not like me because of my poor condition, but I’ll pray and hope for a miracle. If you wished to make the miracle happen, please contact my temporary caretaker(Annie). Thank you. 大家好，我的名字叫小龙。我是一只4个多月大的宅男。 妈妈在一个公寓地下停车场里生下了我们12个兄弟姐妹。 妈妈生下了我们之后，得了子宫颈癌。还好，经过4次的化疗之后， 总算挨过了这一关。 好了，说一说我的小故事吧！ 我出世没多久，在一次意外中，我的小脑袋遭到了严重的撞击，破了3个洞。 从此，当其他的兄弟姐妹已经会走路时，我竟然连爬起来都有问题。 还有，我看东西时也是模模糊糊的。我想我的脑部神经可能被弄坏掉了。 我不知道我几时会好起来，或许永远都会是这样。 幸好，吃了两个月的药以后，我总算可以站起来走路。然而，有时还是会跌跌撞撞的。 由于暂养我的主人不能长期收留我，所以我想透过面子书， 寻找一位愿意照顾我一辈子的好心人。 只是，以我这样的生世，或许很难吧。。。。。 有意领养我的好心人，请联络我的暂养主人(Annie)。 我会在这里努力的生活到最后一刻，乖乖的等待我的新主人。请别让我等太久哦。。。 谢谢大家。",8,3

I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!",5,2

6517,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

FooFoo is smart, once taught (scolded 😅) not to cross the door into house, she always stay out at the door (occasionally crossed the border when get excited when we come back) but immediately dash out once her name called. She is potty-trained too, always do her business at one corner of the balcony. FooFoo doesn't simply make noise or bark, she whine a bit to get attention but it doesn't whine long. She will carry on entertaining herself after whining for a minute or two. She might not have the most attractive puppy face but her sweet personality will sure melts your heart.",3,4

Thank God, she has recovered fully! Emily is a half Doberman Pinscher. She is very playful, sweet, passionate and loves to go for long walks. She waits all day long for me to return home to take her for a walk. Unfortunately, I will be leaving Malaysia in 6 months and I cannot bring her back with me. Please someone be kind and give this little baby a proper, sweet home and she will be your true best friend until her last moments on Earth! All the best, Dino PS.

5585,Dog,48,Miniature Pinscher,Female,Black,Brown,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Minor Injury,180,"20 April update: MinPin is on trial adoption MinPin was found on a busy road and is being put up for adoption since no one claimed her. She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.",9,3

I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",5,3

(story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too!

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say ""is that all?"". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!!

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- Her story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. G3 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",8,3

2626,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Yellow,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",2,4

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him.

Cookie The friendliest to human of the three kittens. He recognises us as food providers and will come and meow for food. He has short hair, and black patches on a white coat. He looks much different from the other two littermates. Am looking for a good family who will spay him and care for him. Please watsapp me at or email me at if you are interested. Thanks!",7,1

4077,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Yellow,Small,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"Hello. Meet Tookins, who reinvents herself from a traumatised stray to a techno savvy kitten. She is about 3-4 weeks old. She is an adorable Calico with a stumpy tail that wiggles when she is super happy. I found her in the middle of a busy road, too scared to move. Luckily she was not hurt. Just shocked. Even from that first encounter, I knew that she is one lovable kitty. Her hobbies include playing with anything that moves, glows or just plain old bits of paper. She loves cuddling to her Mrs Bunny, her bff. Tookins is a natural-born cuddler and a lap kitty. Also a shoulder kitty. Out of all her long list of repetoires, she is also a Youtube and Netflix bingewatcher. She loves teenage movies with good villains in it. Tookins has been checked by the vet and she has been given a clean bill of health. She has been dewormed and deloused (Advocate). She cannot be vaccinated yet as she is so tiny according to the vet. Tookins eats boiled tuna, Whiskas Kitten pouch food and Royal Canin Kitten. She is fully toilet trained and at the moment stays indoors at all times for health and safety reasons. As you can see, she is well loved by my family. As a kitten rescuer and fosterer though, I am willing to share my love for her with a responsible forever family who will care for her unconditionally. If I found her a good home, I can rescue more kittens in need. There is no adoption fee. All I am asking is for Tookins' future mom or dad to: 1. NEUTER her as soon as she can be safely neutered. 2. Make sure her VACCINATIONS are up-to-date 3. Provide her with everything she needs to stay safe, comfortable and happy for the rest of her life. So if you are looking for a quirky, fun-loving, cuddly and not to mention super adorable wee fluff, look no further, for Tookins is your kind of kitten. Please do not hesitate to send me a message. I will then give you a questionaire to be filled in. Thank you. Nini",13,3

We had good times together, I made him laugh so many times and he put a smile in my heart too. But times are not easy. I am up for adoption again because my owner wants the best for me.

I did try to talk to his owner, apparently she won't take my advice seriously. Jack Jack feds on human ta pau food. Three times a week. That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack. Oh yes, he responds to this name given by me. And yes, he has no name with his previous owner.

Other cars that followed also slowed down to see what was happening.As I neared the fellow it ran to the side of the divider and to the pavement. Luckily for this divider there was a big piece of land (pavement). Seeing that he was safe for a moment, I went back to my car and drove slightly up as I was blocking the traffic. Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain. Oh! dear I thought, every where was covered up except this part and in he went. I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him.

I like playing and running around, but sometimes, I like to sit down and ponder about life, or what I'm having for dinner. Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances. Someone please save this little kitten !!!",3,1

Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time.

Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends.

She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then...

Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",2,4

3134,Dog,3,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,No Color,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,0,"2 months ago, this small skinny black puppy (with a streak of white on her chest) under a car with serious maggots infested head injury was found. With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period. She is such a fighter against all odds despite the serious injury at such an early tender age of her life. She is growing up to be a beautiful and loving girl. Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13). As such, we are seeking kind adopter to give Blessed a chance to have a loving home immediately after having just a hard life on the street. Please call/sms WM Cheong ( )",2,4
9555,Dog,84,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,Gray,Large,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Update as at 20 Feb : We believe this dog was abandoned in our neighbourhood. Big built like a Rottweiler, but a very gentle & lovable dog. Doesnt bark at all, but will whine & may howl a bit in excitement when he sees you. Gets along fine with other dogs & even cats. One of the few dogs i know that doesnt bark or chase cats when he sees one in close proximity. Appears to be in good health condition & has no signs of illness or injuries. Please consider adopting him & giving him a chance for a better life. He'd really make a good pet with his calm personality. Update as at 16 Jan : Dog is still around. He is so scared & just hides under the cars all the time. Refused food for many days & just started eating since yesterday. Definitely had an owner before. If you think you know his owner, please let them know that their dog misses home terribly. 5 Jan : Spotted this dog roaming around Bandar Utama (BU 11). Not sure if it is a stray that made its way here or a lost dog. Appears old but generally looks well taken care of, although very timid. Has a very unique stumpy tail. Hopefully it is not an abandoned dog!",5,4

9730,Dog,5,Shar Pei,Male,Brown,Golden,Large,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,200,"A minor car accident brought about a trip to a car workshop which in turn caused the car owner to chance upon a 5 -month -old Shar Pei mixed puppy (male), now named Bear Bear. Seeing the deplorable condition the puppy is living in (lying around the floor with spilled engine oil, water container contaminated with all sorts of automobile oil and God knows if he's been fed properly), the car owner decided to probe a bit further into how he's been treated all this while. According to some folks around that area, Bear Bear used to have 3 other siblings but Bear Bear is the only one left as the other three were run down by cars which came to the workshop to get their cars fixed. Bear Bear has been brought to the vet for a checkup and blood test. Blood test results show that he's fighting some form of infection and is currently on a course of antibiotics. He has also got cherry eyes (the large red mass bulging out of the inner corner of his eyes. those are actually his own tear glands which popped out) . Anyone who knows about cherry eyes will know that it's a condition which is not visually appealing, but fairly common (especially in certain breeds, Shar Pei is one of them) . However it's actually benign (non life threatening) and can be corrected via surgery. Bear Bear is currently under observation and boarding at the vet's clinic. If all goes well, he would be vaccinated in a couple of days. Since the cherry eye condition is non life threatening, priority is given towards treating his infection. Bear Bear is very friendly towards humans and quiet (not whiny, and exudes a calm personality) We are currently appealing for anyone who can help foster him till he recovers from infection and ready for adoption. Kindly drop us a note at if you could foster Bear Bear whilst we work on getting him rehomed. Please contact Mun Ee for more info =) www.facebook.com/PawsMission",5,4

In front of Wisma Tractors, I noticed a black velvety furry ball by the side of the road as many cars were driving past. As I got closer I saw 2 twinkling lights from the furry ball. I quickly did a U turn and crossed the road to find it was this little kitten, shivering in fright but not running. It was just lying 6 inches away from the wheel of passing cars. I picked it up and took it to my car. The kitten was very afraid of the vet and wet itself and started hissing in fear, but it was fine when I picked it up. The vet said one leg is broken and needs complete rest for 1 month. As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them. It’s now time for it to have a home and has lost weight because it doesn’t like being caged. It is a very well behaved kitten. I have named it “Little One” and its coat was like Mink with slightly longish fur. Please Give “Little One” a home. Contact Hema.",2,2

She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back. But no such reason eg: She is already old. Hard to care for it. 4)Give updates whenever you have time.Anyone who is interested please do PM or email me a msg.

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out..

Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite!

True to his strong stray lineage, he came charging last Friday afternoon and barked loudly at our three big dogs. That was how little Caleb came into our life. He is a very intelligent and alert pup. He barks along with the pack whenever strangers come to our gate. He is active and trainable. He has learned to poo and pee on the same spot, calling us whenever he needs to do his business when he's locked up in his cage. He is learning to chew only on the 'rag doll' we made for him. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, and he behaved very well at the vet clinic. He doesn't have motion sickness; he was sleek clean in the 1+ hr car ride to the clinic. Overall, he is a quiet, happy, intelligent and brave young chap. Although we have grown fond of Caleb, we would really love to see him living with a loving family. We already have three dogs and three cats - all strays who came our way and nestled with us when they could find no place to call home.

She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs.

She came to us two years ago when she was roaming the street, having been abandoned or thrown out by her previous owner. She then decided to adopt us (yep - she waited in front of our gate every day until we took her in) and has since been the reason for many laughs. Even though she must have had bad experiences before she is very trusting and curious and I have never seen her aggressive towards people. She will always try to stay close to one of us. Although she is very alert she rarely barks and is generally very calm. She has learned some commands but needs some additional training to listen really well. Rosie would be ideal for a family with kids as she is very gentle and patient. She is currently living inside the house as well as outside in the garden, so please no small cages or chain for her. Even though we leave the dogs alone during the days she has never chewed or destroyed anything. I hope a new family can give her the life and love she deserves.

As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

418,Cat,2,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,White,Medium,Short,No,No,Healthy,200,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

Not only were they hungry & thirsty; they were covered with red ants all over their tiny bodies.One pup was dead by the time our Photographer cum volunteer arrived. FeiLing quickly brought the remaining 4 straight to one of our supporting veterinary clinics.Inspite of their pain,their hunger took over.Even the weakest ate but it died within hours. The third died the next morning. These two are indeed the lucky ones.

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",2,2

She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home.

Kenzo is loving, funny and super friendly boy. He is a clingy & spoilt cat with adorable attitude. Active and playful but will collapse after 5-10mins of playing, maybe because he is kinda fat. He has a weird habit of grinding his teeth which is cuteeeee that might fix your mood swing. Litter trained. His light blue eyes are very captivating and could melt your heart instantly.

10485,Dog,5,German Shepherd Dog,Female,Black,Brown,Medium,Short,Not Sure,No,Healthy,550,"********** NEW Update ********** C’mie, the lost dog from Padang Merbok / Bukit Tunku is now available for adoption. My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",5,2

It all started at 25th December . A beagle was found resting under a tree near my garage.He was thirsty and hungry.Realizing it was a pure breed Beagle that could probably be someone else's pet,I temporarily adopted the beagle.However,my own dogs didn't seemed to welcomed him as much as we do by barking at beagle most of the time.So,our neighbour adopted the beagle as they seemed to like the beagle so much.Unfortunately,this wasn't the truth.The neighbour had been very irresponsible by letting the beagle to wander around the streets even on heavy rainy days.Desperated,I asked for explaination and requested that the beagle deserves a better owner.The neighbour didn't seemed to feel sorry about their actions and blamed it on the poor beagle.It had only been a week since they adopted the beagle and we can see significant loss of weight in the beagle.However,they gave an excuse that someone in their family will soon be home to take care the beagle.we decided to give them one last chance to repay what they had done but Unfortunately it turns out to be just another wrong decision.This time,the excuse is that the family member which is responsible for taking care of the beagle is leaving Malaysia soon and...=.= Never ending... BUT... they finally gave in when i requested to get the beagle a Good owner again today-4th january . So right now i'm searching for a good, responsible, loving, and patient owner for this beagle. Having a pet is like caring a baby,Not just another plush toy! So,feel free to contact me if you are ready to give your best and you will certainly be surprised by what you would get from this little beagle!! ^0^ Sincerely, Silver Star",5,3

6803,Cat,36,Shih Tzu,Male,Brown,Cream,Medium,Long,Not Sure,No,Healthy,0,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.",2,1
