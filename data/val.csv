He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.",6c399cb06,2.0,1

Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",923a03e90,30.0,2

Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy.

My parents always wanted me to put them up for adoption as I already own 3 dogs and I will be leaving to Overseas to further my studies. However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the ""Lion King"" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the ""stranger"". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent. Both of them are the perfect family dogs and they can guard the house pretty well. #FunFacts about them that make them adorable: 1. They are afraid of fireworks. 2. They are always wag their tails when you are home! 3. They love being pet and never get sick of being complimented. 4. Just simply because they are super ADORABLE AND LOVABLE!",c634af483,5.0,4

But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can.

They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary.

Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested.

She is a large cat with very striking tabby markings and a bold personality to match! I work at Zoo Negara and sadly we have a lot of people dumping pets at the zoo. Cats can spread disease to the zoo animals, so the zoo staff are forced to catch the cats and ""get rid"" of them to ensure the safety and health of the other animals on site. Kate is one of these cats, and is looking for a ""forever"" home where she can share her love and affection with an understanding owner. I estimate she is around one year old, and she was caught along with two kittens which are also up for adoption (same tabby stripe markings, also up for adoption). Although she has not been vaccinated/ dewormed/ spayed yet, all of these will be done if you agree to adopt her. She has a full tail.

It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious.

My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions.

It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays.

We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal.

Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you. She do not like to be carried or hugged, but sometimes she will be very manja, she will just sit beside you and ask for your love and a pat on head. Please give a home to Picasso ♥",bf9bd91e1,8.0,4

However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too!

All of them seem to be healthy and growing very steadily. Following their mother's size, they are likely to grow into medium sized dogs. Their mother is a very attached, affectionate, and agile dog. I suspect that they may grow into great companion and guard dogs if you care for them. At present their eyes are still shut but they seem to be able to sense what is in front of them. I had so much difficulties trying to take their photos as they would ""shy away"" from where the camera pointed at them. Their markings look like they are most likely going to have solid colours, some socks, some ridgeback-like lines, some tuxedo chests, maybe one cream too.

Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her.

He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",8c1658988,30.0,2

She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles.

She runs to you whenever called with her curly tail wagging. She loves being pet and will lie on her back for belly rubs and tickles. ♥ Bessy needs time to adjust to other dogs, she is however extremely loving towards people (she's good with cats too!). She likes crashing near people's feet before grooming herself/falling asleep. ♥ Bessy is quite playful and loves chew toys (lots and lots of them). She is not hyper however and is rarely noisy (unless caged). ♥ Bessy has been going ""potty"" in the garden since her first foster day (% success when going poo, mishaps sometimes when going pee). She will never mess up her sleep/play area. ♥ Bessy is able to eat puppy kibbles independently (she will appreciate some yummy canned/cooked meat now and then though!). ***PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters*** ♥ Bessy will only be ready to leave to a new home in 10 days time (Oct 8th). A slight portion of her fur had to be shaved to treat a tiny wound (healing well). She has a course of antibiotics to complete. ♥ Bessy will appreciate an indoor environment, she loves loves lovesss spending time with people (adoption priority given to people practicing this). ♥ Bessy MUST be spayed/neutered at the right age (No breeding).

Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come. He enjoys food, especially pure chunks of chicken breast, high 5 bread with butter (though the vet's advised not to give him butter as it's bad for dog's pancrease), and his kibbles!

Note: he's a penchant to escape from homes where he doesn't feel loved, whereas at his fosterers..even when he strays out, he'd hang around just outside the home, knowing there's love and security there.

He adores people and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken. ♥ This boy needs a little time to adjust around other cats (long as they are not aggressive his way, he'll take only a few days). He's as gentle as his brother and will not use claws harsly when playing with us. ♥ Floren is on the road to recovery from a mild skin issue he had post rescue and is otherwise a healthy boy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. He prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Floren must be kept % indoors for his own safety.

She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough.

I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but it´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But it’s not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them. If you have any problems in keeping them, you can return them to us immediately, no questions asked. If it is important to you, the cats stay in a ""halal"" household.

She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good.

We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",79db05f63,3.0,2

She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.",8079e3a1c,9.0,3

Please read their details below:- Fruitcake is a few minutes older than Marble & slightly smaller than Marble. Fruitcake loves hugs, pets, and fruitcake likes to talk.She responses with a meow, coupled with interested eyes. She cant understand you but she can understand your voice tone. She doesnt like it when my dog barks loudly in the house & she meows at my dog. A cat like gesture of ""please be quiet im trying to sleep"". Fruitcake LOVES fish and gets super excited each time I steam a couple of fishes for her and Marble. She loves running around the house specially during playtime & loves to be brushed. Overall she's a happy little kitty. Marble is younger than Fruitcake. She's the most playful kitty out of her siblings. Her big communicative playful eyes will surely keep you interested in her mischief. She learned how to play catch as a kitten & she loves it when you play hide & seek with her. She'll keep on playing till she pants like a dog & She'll always want to try on what you've in your mouth, especially ripe sweet mangoes, thats her fav fruit. She has issues with hugs (like most female cats do), but once she's brushed she'll ask for more and wont let you stop. Marble is also quite talkative, loves to eat and run around. If you're looking for a playful kitty, Marble would be fit to your preference. Note : FRUITCAKE & MARBLE'S BIRTH DATE IS ON THE 21ST NOV ! ** Fruitcake & Marble are siblings. Their mom adopted me to be her & her baby's caretaker. She just walked in the house, pregnant, and gave birth while I was her acting nurse. ** THEY ARE LITTER TRAINED. ** Fruitcake & Marble are inseparable. You can choose to adopt one of them, but it's best if you keep them together. They really adore & love each other. They are each others' motivator. ** They are kept in my apartment, never steps out my house and they have never been sick within the 2 years and 7 months (and counting) of their lives. ** Fruitcake & Marble both love fish, specially steamed fish coupled with a good fish broth. ** If you want to adopt them, please make sure to take good care of them. As their pet parent, I really care for their happiness & comfort & well being. ** You must be responsible & caring with these babies and you should tend to their needs, which they will definitely give you love, % in return. ** They aren't vaccinated & de-wormed. But if you are keen on adopting them, I will vaccinate & deworm them before handing them over to you. I ** Please option on neutering Fruitcake & Marble. This is to reduce the unnecessary babies, which would lead to abandoning. ** Once you agree to take them under your care, you, as the new owner should NEVER OPTION on abandoning them.

Please consider adopting him & giving him a chance for a better life. He'd really make a good pet with his calm personality. Update as at 16 Jan : Dog is still around. He is so scared & just hides under the cars all the time. Refused food for many days & just started eating since yesterday. Definitely had an owner before. If you think you know his owner, please let them know that their dog misses home terribly. 5 Jan : Spotted this dog roaming around Bandar Utama (BU 11).

I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end.

BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had.

It saddens me to know that people DO NOT READ the pet's condition before agreeing to adopt. Brothers and sisters, please know that adopting a dog is really taking full responsibility for a life of another and is a serious matter. Placing a dog in different homes especially with his condition is already stressful enough for him. Please sit down and think before agreeing to give this poor boy a new home. Thank you. ********************************** I adopted Samba back in and was informed that he had been abused during the four years that he was being taken cared of. He was caged most of the time and according to the doctor he was also beaten. Samba is an extremely gentle and loyal dog, and will follow you everywhere you go. He does not like being left alone, and is ONLY kept indoors. He is extremely afraid of loud noises especially when it is raining or when there are fireworks. Samba is also potty trained, and needs to go for his walks as frequent as possible. Unless you have a backyard in which he is able to go to the toilet then he needs his daily walks at least once a day. It would be great if I can find him a good home, someone who has A LOT, A LOT of patience. Kindly contact me through here if interested.",461b33f39,1.0,4

Very affectionate chap. He doesn't complain alot, he just wants love, he doesn't care if you're going to hurt him. :(! Really! Great companion. He purrs when I'm near, or just by hanging out with me. Sesame is sometimes too brave, he likes to hang out with cats who aren't very easy with him around, wants to make friends he said, says he doesn't want to make enemies haha. Sesame's the runt, meaning he is smaller than average cats. Has a best buddy in the whole world, Peanuts. Peanuts: Follows wherever Sesame goes. Both Sesame & Peanuts are usually seen running around the field like in cartoons. Peanuts is very timid, craves to be around you, but just scared. I believe he had some bad past with humans. ONLY! when you close your eyes or pretend you're not looking at him, he'll come close, haha! Alot of times Peanuts squint his eyes during day time when there's sun, like as if he just came out from the cave, we just think he's hinting us for a pair of sunnies. Very CUTE meows, playful, he's the one who initiates all the games with Sesame. :) Just like Sesame, they like to hang out with bigger cats whether the other cats like it or not, says they want to make friends, not war. I'm looking for committed, serious, adopters. Adopters who will make sure they will be taken care of, ensure they will not run away to become stray again. They are both preferred to be given to the same adopter. Rescued by me, and I will be willing to get them vet-checked, neutered, and microchipped. Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again. Both of them must go together to the same adopter. Kitties and I will appreciate your help so much. Thanks for dropping by. :)!",6da1ee245,25.0,4

Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer.

If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion.

He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",74088eee1,4.0,3

Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine!

Aboo is a house-cat but is allowed to go out once in a while. He's litter trained and very adaptable to the type of litter used (clumping clay, crystal, Okoplus). Food wise, he's not at all a picky eater but we feed him with either Royal Canin or LV fit 31. We send him for grooming every fortnight and I myself had groomed him once in a while and he enjoys getting baths.

She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex.

Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d,5.0,4

I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

However, our friend Sam has rescued and fully treated them and they are now completely healthy and heartworm-free! Sam has been fostering these two dogs for the last 6 months and needs someone to adopt them for good. Both of them are extremely FRIENDLY and playful and love to meet new people (not suitable for guard dog). They need a loving family and home. Let me know if you think you can provide a good home! Note: There will be a fee to help cover the medicine, neutering and vaccination costs Sam already paid for. He also regularly takes in and treats stray dogs so feel free to donate a little extra if you feel kind and want to help the cause! :)",0d4b69793,4.0,2

He just got into the pound earlier that day and was very traumatized as he was been dragged by the noose. I was only able to bail him out from his other three siblings. Reason was because as the cage door opened, this little guy decided to run for his life. He was very fast hence I named him Bolt. Initially, he was afraid of humans as he was dragged by the pound guys by the noose. Now, he has managed to break out of his shell of fear and deemed free of all those dangerous diseases one can find in a dog from the pound. Vaccinated and dewormed. This little guy is full of life and deserves a forever safe home. Please do contact me if you are interested. Please call and not whatsapp or SMS if you are a serious adopter.

This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

My husband bumped into him a couple of nights ago when “Fluffy” approached him. We have been feeding him dinner as other times, he went gallivanting and probably found his own meals. “Fluffy” is obviously domesticated which makes him sociable & approachable. He is sweet, affectionate and playful. We would love to keep him (it’s hard not to when he gives us that cute look!) but we already have 3 cats of our own. We think “Fluffy” may be less than a year old, may have been neutered and toilet-trained.

I want to protect both from injure and harm and decided to find a good owner for putih, a good and wide area for putih not in cage, He is a sweet cat and charming,toilet train (he ""pub"" using toilet litter sand, He NO spray or NO urinate everywhere), he just feel unsecure with Kiko near him and outside, in evening is hot so, i don't want putih to suffer being cage all the way in his life. So hoping somebody kind and good, care to adopt him.For your info, I sometime let putih out from cage and locked Kiko in one of my room, cause Putih seem like unsecure and ready to attack Kiko if he see Kiko and of cause Kiko will try to protect himself. I cannot keep up with this anymore because I need to search for a job myself,my life and my husband,cause i am not employed for a moment, and will have to search for work soon,so I really need to settle ""Putih"" problem as soon as possible. p/s:(already adopted by welee lee.

Please call us if you can give Buster the home that he deserves! ******************** We found Buster last Sunday (13/4/14) in Bukit Indah, Ampang. He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love.

I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me).

They were fairly friendly pups who were fostered in only a tiny toilet as their ""home"" (where they ate/slept/poo/pee-ed). They lived for months with almost zero outside world or human contact, and this eventually took a toll on them. ♥ Both siblings were later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). Worse yet, their spirits had been killed and they had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- Good news though!! ♥ Prada and Louis have been under proper foster care and have already made TREMENDOUS progress! ♥ Louis is absolutely friendly (see pics of him below), while Prada is getting extremely curious and edging closer to us day by day. ♥ Prada & Louis are also VERY alert, will bark and make good watch-dogs (not guard-dogs). At other times they have very laid back temperaments. ♥ Both Prada and Louis are looking for understanding and loving new families who can show them the love and life that they lost as puppies, to help them break out of their past endurance entirely. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Prada and Louis should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for temporary needs).

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 13-May-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell the puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (12) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call  or . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",0ac2e7d16,20.0,1

He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail.

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead! Please PM me if you want to adopt this darling and help share and spread the word to anyone you know who's had dogs, but doesn't have one at the moment and wants one and only one now :)",a5b9343c3,1.0,2

Caesar is up for adoption as the owner is currently suffering from back injury and could not spend enough time to bring her out for walks and see to her needs. Caesar will be spayed and the adoption fee of RM is to cover for spaying fee, blood test, general check up. She is currently on tick prevention & heart worm prevention (Feb & Mar ). Caesar is NOT a guard dog. She does bark at strangers at the gate occasionally. She's friendly and is very energetic. She plays with anyone. She loves charging and jumping (which may not be suitable for households with small kids - unless with strict supervision and discipline). Caesar is still a puppy, without proper exercise, she is rather destructive (she chews slippers, auto gate cable, car bumper when left unsupervised). With sufficient exercise, she maintains a clean record for the past 3 weeks with us (she did not destroy anything at all). If you are willing to provide her with a good home, please contact me by leaving me a message. We prefer to re-home her to a new home within Klang Valley. Please describe: (1) Your experience with dogs (if any) (2) The environment you intend to provide her with (no cage, no unnecessary tie-up) (3) Please state if you agree to a 1-month trial in which we will visit once or twice to see if it is a good match Please note that those who do not describe the 3 key points will not get a reply from us.

She was abandoned by the roadside under the scorching hot sun (was around 2pm when i stumble upon her). She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food. She survived after eating 12 chocolates! One hell of a tough dog I must say. I'm running out of time, really desperate for an adopter. I really do not wish to put her back on the street.

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6.0,3

Here is the summary of Lulu's life... Came to my residence few yrs ago. Often hides underneath drain due to the dog-haters here. When it rains, she'll still hide underneath despite rising water level. I had a dog & she does not like Lulu around. So I built her a make-shift shelter outside my house & feed her. A new neighbor moved in. I talked to them & they decided to take her & named her Lulu. For a time being, she had proper shelter & food. Recently, the wife is pregnant & they decided to throw Lulu away at a Malay village..! I was furious & scolded him. A friend helped to get Lulu a temporary place at a pet store (My Pet Centre, Setia Alam). The owner agreed not to charge me boarding fees as long as I pay for the dog food, vaccination & spaying costs. Although it was a burden on me, but I have paid all the costs. Lulu is now recovering from her spaying surgery this week. But owner of pet store wanted Lulu out before Hari Raya!! Time is ticking for Lulu.. She is a super friendly dog & does not bark excessively. She has the look of a long-hair Jack Russell terrier. Please help to share for possible adoption by any dog lovers, thank you all.",7a7277559,1.0,4

Her coat is slightly diluted so she seems more greyish than brown. - She was rescued on the street by a friend but she is so so human friendly for a street kitty! - Was found very thin and I think she cried a lot..her voice is very rusty or maybe its just like that. - I have dewormed her and have done checkups to see if she has an infection or prarasites. Eats and plays very fine now! - She has minor injury on her chin (thus her name lol) - please refer to images. It is healing. - Again, she is VERY VERY human friendly. She loves to cuddle and sleep right beside me or behind me when I do my work. I go out and come back to find her on my pillow. She calls to sit with me when she's bored playing. - Please make sure to be a responsible owner for this lovely kitty. Bring her for with vaccination. This is crucial and please spay/neuter when the time is right to reduce the homeless strays we have. - I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine. :)",8ab904da2,8.0,2

My daily diet is as follows: for breakfast I enjoy a can of fancy feast premium cat canned food followed by free-flow royal canin dry food as my in between snacks. I need to drink a lot of water. I am toilet trained. Please provide cat litter tray with a reasonable amount of sand. Please keep me in door and do not leave your doors or windows open. I am a health freak; daily vitamins of 2 capsules of yeast is a must for me as I am crazy about my vitamins to keep my body and color attractive. Not to worry as you need not mince my vitamins. Just put 2 capsules in my cat bowl and I will take care of it! I am very independent. If you can meet my requests above, please take me home and promise me that you will give me everlasting love. Please do not apply if you are planning to feed Kimmie with left overs food, friskies or whiskas or equivalent, rice etc. Candidates are encouraged to apply provided you are prepared to feed Kimmie with royal canine (sensible) and fancy feast premium canned food.

I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",b1c83d13b,4.0,1

Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog.
