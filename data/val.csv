She was a friendly dog and used to hang around a taman but, one day she was discovered with a broken hind leg. Someone has lured her with some food and beat her up, broke her leg. She was brought to a vet by my husband to get treatment. Pooja is now a disabled dog. She is in a temporary foster home. Pooja is looking for a forever home. She seeks a person who is good with understanding dogs. Because of her disabled condition she currently does not get along quite well with the foster home dogs (maybe they are too active for her). Pooja will do well with a house that has a compound, just for her to have space to walk around. She also comes with a blue cage which she feels safe inside. Please contact Ms. Visha at",3,3

2029,Dog,12,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,No Color,Large,Medium,Yes,Not Sure,Healthy,0,A friend of mine found this dog on a highway in Shah Alam a couple of days ago. But he can't keep it in his house due to some personal reasons. I am currently looking after it but it can only be temporary as I can't keep pets in my house either. So I'm looking for someone who would adopt this puppy and give him a good new home. I'm unsure about its age or breed but I'm guessing he's a mixed breed or mongrel and is only about a year old. He had a collar when he was given to us but with no information on it. We have named him Shadow for now and would hope that someone would come adopt it soon. Contact me at. I live in Subang.,3,4

He is also quiet when left alone. Distemper is potentially fatal in puppies with weak immune system, but can survive if their immune system is improved with good food and supplements. Due to this, interested adopters have to wait at least 6 months and retest for distemper, before vaccination and neutering can be done. Adopters who have other dogs must ensure their other dogs have been completely vaccinated and do not have puppies/sick or recovering dogs. Distemper poses no health risk to humans. If interested, please contact Jocelyn at to give this lovely active boy a good life.",5,3

618,Dog,11,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Cream,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Brim (short for Brimstone) was rescued by me three months ago. I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel. As I am only visiting Malaysia I need to find Brim a suitable home as a matter of urgency. If interested please email or phone [no messages please].",5,4

I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter.

Now the kitten is up for adoption as we dont have the capacity to take care of it and we don't really want to send it to a shelter because we know for sure a kitten at that age will not survive the shelter condition.

We have been feeding it dry kitten kibbles soak in milk at home. It's still quite fiece but we suspect its due to the poor eye sight (due to young age).

Trust me, she really looks like smaller-eyes-version Bolt. This lousy pic of her doesnt justify how cute she is! My friend had adopted her for nearly 2 months. He gave up on her due to her extremely submissive nature. She does well with other dogs but not so much with human. This is because she used to be a strayed puppy before someone picked her up & sent her to the vet. My friend is not a patient owner. He doesnt like the fact that she runs away everytime we go near her. She loves eating & will only come to you when you have food. Although she is a very submissive dog, she still greeted us when we came back from work. At the moment, she is a dog's dog & not so much of people's dog. She doesnt bark much unless she is playing with other dogs. She gets along very well with one of my mongrel dog. So i assume that she has no problem getting along with other dogs. Please bear in mind that she is not a people's dog as she was a strayed dog previously. I m looking for a very patient & loving owner who is willing to spend time with her & take care of her so that she is not reluctant of interacting with human being.

Hopefully any of you kind souls out there who are willing to adopt Aboo, please contact me at soon.

5351,Dog,48,Miniature Pinscher,Female,Black,Brown,Small,Short,Yes,Not Sure,Healthy,0,"Woof! Can you please be my master and give me a forever home? My name is Lucy. I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe? Call Ms. at to schedule a play date with me.",5,3

She was drinking from oil filled water spots and begging for food from stalls. She was always alone. It was such a pity for a little kitty like her and the danger of being run over was always there. I thought proving clean water & food would suffice, but I just couldn't leave her there. After a couple of days, took her back home and got her to the vet. Got her examined, especially her eye. The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play.

2598,Dog,2,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,White,Medium,Short,Yes,No,Healthy,0,"Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful.

9636,Dog,1,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,No Color,Small,Short,Not Sure,No,Healthy,0,"-rescued from a drain in Kuantan (20th Dec ) -male, around 6 weeks old -healthy -cute and active Characteristic -black colour mouth -fur brown -one paw white -tail black -scared of loud noises I've done a great deed as I've rescued and helped a little puppy, Arlo to find a new loving home. Mission Accomplished! I wish to help more homeless puppies and strays as Arlo really encouraged me to do so. Arlo was scared of living with a family after I brought him home.He was so afraid of us. He was growling at me and wanted to bite. I used 2 hours to get his trust. After 2 hours, he wagged his tail first time in front of me. The next day, he came towards me when I called his name. He let me pet his head the first time without growling at me. After two days, he played with me, listen to me when I trained him and gave me to shake his paw. In two days, Arlo and I had became friends. Arlo is one intelligent puppy that could remember all the tricks I've taught him. On 23th Dec , I found Arlo a family that could spend more time with him and could love him. I was so sad when I sent him to his new family. Even though we had just being together for 2 days, I had so much fun with Arlo. I was so miserable when I see him taken away by his new owner. But, I am glad that Arlo found a better family and I am very happy to see the photos they sent to me, a photo of a very happy Arlo. I will miss Arlo forever!",3,1

He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would!

We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him.

Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7,3

9089,Dog,7,Beagle,Female,Black,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Healthy,500,"For more pics go here: 9th April edit: I have revised the adoption fee to RM to include the fee I paid her breeder. The reason I am now making reimbursement of the breeder's fee compulsory is to help out Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). Previously if Donut's adopter voluntarily reimbursed the breeder's fee I had planned to donate the RM to MDDB anyway, since they really need funding I reckon a sincere adopter won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. 6th April edit: The family who intended to adopt Donut backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with Donut herself). So this bundle of beagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) 5th March edit: I have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. Apparently some people can't read - DONUT HAS BEEN SPAYED. Meaning she can't get pregnant. If you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contacting me. Donut is an affectionate beagle that loves human and canine company. Trained to do toileting on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. Well socialised and impervious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly snooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! She has some good and bad traits typical of beagles. The good: She's a pack animal as beagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab pup and even my temperamental adult mutt). Very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. The bad: She loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with beagles). So if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. She will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all teething puppies. 9th April edit: This isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (beagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, Donut has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted unsupervised with them. She has killed squirrels and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/hamsters/sugar gliders etc.) she would not be a good fit. She's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but I would not advise keeping her if you have kittens as I'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. For those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: She is the product of an irresponsible breeder - I'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ Initially I was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own I just cannot give Donut the attention she deserves. I spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. I hope she will find a loving home where love can be lavished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. Adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and spaying costs. On top of those expenses I had to pay off the breeder to have Donut released to me (otherwise the breeder would have dumped her at SPCA or pawned her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backyard breeder). If you are a serious adopter and able to reimburse me for the breeder's fee (RM) this would be greatly appreciated - I will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [PLEASE NOTE the 9th April edit on top of this listing - the breeder's fee is now compulsory.) I am going to be blunt and state upfront that I can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. After all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (I wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and I am in no hurry rehome her. My priority is finding Donut a home where she will receive more love and attention than I can give her at the moment. Bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. You MUST have time for her. Donut thrives on attention - when I first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). As such I strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. If Donut will be the only dog in the household, I would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retiree/homemaker/work-at-home/kids). 2. No tying or caging up (unless you find a constantly howling beagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover medical costs and breeder's fee. 4. Patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all puppies. 5. Maintain her on a premium kibble (she is currently on Orijen)/raw food diet. 6. Allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her wellbeing (as such I am looking for adopters in the KL/Selangor area so that this is possible). 7. Lavish her with love, love and more love! :) I would appreciate it if you could email a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt Donut. I will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion.",10,3

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.

I am currently fostering at Selangor. - NO students. Priority for locals. (Unless you can convince me, if you are an international) - Prefer working adults to support food, health and etc expenses. -** Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. (I MAY ask for the deposit of first year vaccination and will return once you have vaccinated the kitten with proof. I may or may not. However you are required to inquire at your preferred clinic and inform me on the vaccination amount. (Please understand this is only to assure she will be in good hands, and caring owners will not hesitate) - Please spay/neuter when she is 6 months old (December /January ) as this will make her healthier and happier. - Please avoid outdoors as she may want to go out often, get into cat fights, catch diseases and etc. Be with her if you want to let her out. ....................................................................................................

If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" .................................................................................................... ......................ABOUT KITTEN......................... - She was rescued by one of the owners of Happie n Jovie ( Centrepoint BU ). She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten. Thanks for your time to read through! ....I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine.",18,3

Against all odds, this tough pup responded incredibly well to antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, making a miraculous recovery and not requiring surgery at all! His leg is fully healed and he runs around like nothing ever happened. Because of his rough start to life, Ringo has shown a maturity beyond his months. He is lower maintenance than other puppies and, though he is very shy with strangers, is the most good-natured and lovable dog once you gain his trust.",4,2

I am giving her away for a fee for which includes everything she has done so far including her vaccinations which is worth up to ringgit. She has done all 3 vaccinations and have fininshed her medications for heart worm which lasted for 6 months. She's an active happy puppy who loves the outdoors. She's quite scared of other dogs but once she's slowly introduced to them she get excited playing with them. She got along with my female german shepherd very well. She's indoor self trained pup. The moment we brought her in we see where she usually does her business and from there we put her pee pad or pee pan and she continuously goes back to the same place. Smart dog knows simple commands (sit, paw, down) Usually only when there's food around. She love her naps and usually sleeps facing upwards which is quite cute. The fee covers her vaccination (~RM) and adoption fee (RM) I hope we'll find her a good home someone who will really look after her and hopefully keep her indoors.
