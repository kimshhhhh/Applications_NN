## 1. Project Title

Improve the Performance of Decoding Motor Imagery-based EEG Signals by Investigating the Correlation with Motor Execution-based EEG Signals

## 2. Project Introduction

- The real-world applications are still limited by the decoding performance and generalization ability of the MI-based EEG signals
- MI-based EEG signals are more contaminated than ME-based EEG signals due to low concentration and high fatigue
- ME and MI share neural pathways and represent similar brain activation on the sensorimotor cortex
